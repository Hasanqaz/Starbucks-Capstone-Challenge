This is a capstone challenge provided by Udacity in cooperation with Starbucks, the idea of this challenge is to determine how members are going to respond to an offer based on personal data & offers' details

## File Descriptions
There is 1 notebook available here to showcase work related to the capstone challenge. Markdown cells were used to assist in walking through the thought process for individual steps.

## Results
The main findings of the code can be found at the post available [here](https://medium.com/@hasanshhaa/predict-how-starbucks-members-will-react-to-an-offer-using-machine-learning-fa99f1b4932c)

## Licensing, Authors, Acknowledgements
Must give credit to Starbucks for the data and Udacity for giving the needed training to make this happen. Feel free to use the code here as you would like!
